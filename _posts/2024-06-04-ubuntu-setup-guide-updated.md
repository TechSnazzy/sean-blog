In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system with the following features:

1. **DLNA server with MiniDLNA**: Allows you to stream media files to devices on your network.
2. **Samba for file sharing**: Facilitates file sharing between Linux and Windows systems.
3. **Mounting external USB disks**: Provides a way to access external storage devices.
4. **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with GNOME**: Enables remote access to your Ubuntu desktop.

## 1. Setting Up DLNA Server with MiniDLNA

DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) allows you to stream media files like videos, music, and pictures to compatible devices within your home network. It's a great way to make your media library accessible on smart TVs, game consoles, and other media players.

**Step 1: Install MiniDLNA**

First, we need to install MiniDLNA, a lightweight DLNA server.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install minidlna
```

**Step 2: Configure MiniDLNA**

Next, we configure MiniDLNA to point to the directories where your media files are stored.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/minidlna.conf
```

In the configuration file, add the following lines to specify your media directories:

```plaintext
media_dir=V,/media/USB/MOVIES
media_dir=V,/media/USB/TV
media_dir=V,/media/USB/CONCERTS
media_dir=V,/media/USB/NFL
```

This setup ensures that MiniDLNA serves video files from the specified folders. You can add directories for music and pictures similarly.

**Step 3: Start and Enable MiniDLNA**

Finally, we restart the MiniDLNA service to apply the changes and enable it to start on boot.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart minidlna
sudo systemctl enable minidlna
```

## 2. Setting Up Samba for File Sharing

Samba allows you to share files between Linux and Windows systems. This is particularly useful in mixed-OS environments where you need seamless access to files from any device.

**Step 1: Install Samba**

First, we install the Samba package.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
```

**Step 2: Configure Samba**

Next, we configure Samba by editing its configuration file to define our shared directories.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add the following share definitions:

```plaintext
[FILES]
path = /media/FILES
browseable = yes
read only = no
writable = yes
valid users = sean
create mask = 0777
directory mask = 0777

[USB]
path = /media/USB
browseable = yes
read only = no
writable = yes
valid users = sean
create mask = 0777
directory mask = 0777
```

These settings create two shares: one for general files and another for USB storage, making them accessible over the network.

**Step 3: Set Permissions and Create Samba User**

Set the correct permissions for the shared directories to ensure they are accessible.

```bash
sudo chown -R sean:sean /media/FILES /media/USB
sudo chmod -R 0777 /media/FILES /media/USB
```

Add your user to Samba to manage access.

```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a sean
```

**Step 4: Restart Samba Service**

Finally, restart the Samba service to apply the changes.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
sudo systemctl enable smbd
```

## 3. Mounting External USB Disks

Mounting external USB disks allows you to use external storage devices seamlessly with your system, making it easier to manage large files and backups.

**Step 1: Identify USB Disk**

Identify your USB disk using the `lsblk` command.

```bash
lsblk
```

Assume itâ€™s `/dev/sdb1`.

**Step 2: Create Mount Point**

Create a mount point for the USB disk.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /media/USB
```

**Step 3: Configure fstab**

Get the UUID of the disk.

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sdb1
```

Add the following line to `/etc/fstab`:

```plaintext
UUID=A1B2C3D4E5F67890  /media/USB  ntfs  defaults  0  0
```

Mount all filesystems.

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

This ensures the USB disk is mounted automatically on boot, making it always available without manual intervention.

## 4. Setting Up Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with GNOME

RDP allows you to access your Ubuntu desktop from another machine, such as a Windows PC, making remote management and access convenient.

**Step 1: Install XRDP**

Install the XRDP package.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xrdp
```

**Step 2: Configure XRDP to Use GNOME**

Create or edit the `.xsession` file to use the GNOME session.

```bash
echo "gnome-session" > ~/.xsession
```

Edit the `/etc/xrdp/startwm.sh` file.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
```

Ensure the file contains the following:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if [ -r /etc/profile ]; then
    . /etc/profile
fi

if [ -r ~/.profile ]; then
    . ~/.profile
fi

# start GNOME
export DESKTOP_SESSION=gnome
export XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP=gnome
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME
export GNOME_SHELL_SESSION_MODE=ubuntu
export XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11
export GDMSESSION=ubuntu
unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS

exec /usr/libexec/gnome-session-binary --session=ubuntu
```

This setup ensures that when you connect via RDP, you get a GNOME desktop session.

**Step 3: Allow RDP Through the Firewall**

Allow RDP connections through the firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
```

**Step 4: Restart and Enable XRDP Service**

Restart the XRDP service and enable it to start on boot.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
sudo systemctl enable xrdp
```

## Connecting from Windows

1. **Open Remote Desktop Connection:**
   Open the Remote Desktop Connection application on your Windows 11 machine.

2. **Enter the IP Address:**
   Enter the IP address of your Ubuntu machine (e.g., `192.168.0.115`) and click "Connect."

3. **Log In:**
   Use your Ubuntu username and password to log in.

This completes the setup of your Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system with DLNA, Samba, mounting external USB disks, and RDP. You should now have a fully functional media server and remote desktop setup!
