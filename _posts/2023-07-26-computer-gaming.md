## My New Gaming Computer

I finally decided to bite the bullet and get a gaming computer. I mainly just play fortnite so didn't want to break the bank on this. But I saw this computer on sale for Prime Day so I got it while the getting was good. Skytech Blaze 3.0 which has I5, 16GB RAM, 512 MVMe SSD, Nvidia RTX 3060.
