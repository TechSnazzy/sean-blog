## My New Gaming Computer

I finally decided to bite the bullet and get a gaming computer. I mainly just play fortnite so didn't want to break the bank on this. But I saw this computer on sale for Prime Day so I got it while the getting was good. [Skytech Blaze 3.0 which has I5, 16GB RAM, 512 MVMe SSD, Nvidia RTX 3060](https://a.co/d/cEE4xMX). The link shows about $999 at the time I posted this but I paid about $849. Not bad. So far this computer has been pretty great for playing Fortnite. It even tested pretty well on [userbenchmark.com](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/63002840).
