Hey there! Let's dive into the world of web hosting and domain management that I'm dealing with. If you've ever wondered how websites get set up, here's a sneak peek into my setup with GitHub and more!

### GitHub Pages

My website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and I've got a few different types of pages:

1. **Organization Page**: [TechSnazzy.github.io](https://TechSnazzy.github.io) - This is the hub for everything related to TechSnazzy on GitHub.
2. **Project Page**: [TechSnazzy.github.io/sean-blog](https://TechSnazzy.github.io/sean-blog) - Like this blog right here! You can have multiple project pages, but only one organization or user page.

### Custom Domains

I've also ventured into the domain registration world:

- **[techsnazzy.com](https://techsnazzy.com)**: This is my main business landing page. Feel welcome to explore!
- **[seanmorrison.dev](https://seanmorrison.dev)** and **[seanmorrison.cloud](https://seanmorrison.cloud)**: My playground domains, both pointing to my blog.

Oh, and since Google stepped away from domain registration, I had to move my domains elsewhere.

### DNS Configuration with Cloudflare

Managing domains leads us to the DNS topic. Without diving too deep, I use Cloudflare (it's free!) to handle DNS. Here's how I've set things up:

1. **For [techsnazzy.com](https://www.techsnazzy.com)**:
    - It points to my GitHub organization page and is configured with Microsoft 365.

2. **For .dev and .cloud domains**:
    - On Namecheap, I select "Custom DNS" and input Cloudflare's name servers.
    - Over in Cloudflare, I add a placeholder IP address.
    - Then I create a forwarding rule that takes any visitors to seanmorrison.cloud and redirects them right to [my blog](https://www.techsnazzy.com/sean-blog).

By following these steps, I've connected everything together, from Namecheap to Cloudflare, and then to my blog. Easy peasy!

### Wrap Up

So, that's a quick tour of how I manage my web presence. From hosting on GitHub to playing around with different domains and working with DNS settings, it's an exciting digital playground.
